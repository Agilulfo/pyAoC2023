This repository contains my solutions to the [2023 Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenge.

### DISCLAIMER
I'm aware that my solutions are far from perfect.
Please don't judge me based on what you will see here :)

I just had fun playing around and my main focus was to:

 - try to get to solve each puzzles as quickly as possible to move to the next one
 - use the opportunity to gradually get myself again comfortable with python (I used to use it professionally but I haven't touched it in a while)

In line with the objectives above, not much attention was paid to create elegant, readable, maintainable, efficient and reliable code.
